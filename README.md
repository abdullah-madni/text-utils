This is my first React App named 'TextUtils'.

It is a text utility. By using this you can convert your text to uppercase, lowercase, capitalize, remove extra spaces, and copy your text.

This is also a progressive web app(PWA). Everyone can install this app on any platform and this web app also runs offline.

You can preview my app at (https://text-utils-7.netlify.app/)
